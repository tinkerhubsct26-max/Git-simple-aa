# 🏰 **Welcome to Gondor, brave adventurer!**  

The city of kings stands tall, but danger looms at every gate.  
Dark forces have crossed the plains, and **orcs are now at the very doorstep of Gondor**.  
The battle is close, and the fate of the city rests in your hands.

## ⚔️ Your Mission

Your mission is critical: **prepare a defensive strategy for the city**.  

1. In the `gondor` branch, create a new file named: defense_plan.md
2. Inside that file, write down **three key strategies** that could defend Gondor.  
Be creative — consider:
- Archers on the White Walls  
- Patrols across the battlements  
- Traps in the lower city  
- Magical barriers to repel darkness  

3. Save your plan, then stage, commit, and push it to the `gondor` branch:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Gondor defense plan"
git push origin gondor
```
