# ⚔️ The Git Quest: Journey Through Middle-earth

Welcome, traveler!

Darkness spreads from Mordor, and only through unity can Middle-earth be saved.  
Your mission is to unite the forces of **Rohan** and **Gondor** into one strong alliance.

### 🗺️ Quest - 1:

1. Checkout to the **Rohan** branch and pledge your name.
2. Merge Rohan’s strength into the main branch.

Use your Git commands wisely, for even the smallest commit can change the course of history.
